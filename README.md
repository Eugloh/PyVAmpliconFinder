# PVAmpliconFinder

**PVampliconFinder** is a data analysis workflow designed to rapidly identify and classify known and potentially new *papilliomaviridae* sequences from amplicon deep-sequencing with degenerated papillomavirus (PV) primers.

## Description

PVampliconFinder is based on alignment similarity metrics, but also consider molecular evolution time for an improved identification and taxonomic classification of novel PVs. The final output of the tool includes a list of fully characterized putatively new papillomaviriade sequences, as well as graphical representations of relative abundance of the virome sequence diversity in the tested samples. 

## Prerequisites

The PVampliconFinder workflow is designed for the analysis of sequencing reads generated from **paired-end sequencing** of DNA amplified using degenerated primers targeting specifically the L1 sequence of papillomaviruses ([Chouhy *et al.*, 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19948351),[Forslund *et al.*, 1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10501499),[Forslund *et al.*, 2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12798239)).

### Dependencies & External Software
